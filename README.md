# Brick-Buster-Random-Game
Brick Buster is incredibly simple yet addictive classic game where the player needs to break all the coloured brick layer within 3 minutes to become a BRICK BREAKER HERO !
BRICK BUSTER GAME which is having a touch of cool 90's game. I used python and with the help of pygame module I made this game.
In this the paddle can move only in right and left direction .
The rectangular ball will rebounce in opposite direction when touches the wall. 
Contray to the convention , when the ball hits the bottom wall it again reappear from the centre of the window . 
The game is supposed to be done in 3 mins.
There are 10 different color layer of bricks which changes with the restart of the program.
The game is supposed to be done in 3 mins. If one is able to do so, an  image with the message "GAME OVER ,THANKS FOR PLAYING " will pop up.
